# K & R Exercises and Examples

My takes of **K&amp;R The C Programming Language 2nd edition** book. It includes both the code **examples** and the **answers** for all the exercises.

### Organization

Each _dir_ contains only the code from the specific chapter.

Each example is prefixed with `ex`.

Each exercise is in a separate file, named after the exercise number. (`1-20.c` for exercise 1.20)

### Compiling

I suggest using the c99 standard when compiling: `-std=c99` for all the files.
