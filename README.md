# K & R Exercises and Examples

My takes of **K&amp;R The C Programming Language 2nd edition** book. It includes both the code **examples** and the **answers** for all the exercises.

### Organization

Each _dir_ contains only the code from the specific chapter.

Each example is prefixed with `ex`.

Each exercise is prefixed with the _exercise number_ and `e`.

Some of the answers are inspiered or copied from [clc-wiki](http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K&R2_solutions).

My code is indented GNU style while the foreign code is indented K&R style.

### Compiling

I suggest using the c99 standard when compiling: `-std=c99` for all the files.
